These med tech's will do other things that could be done at other times instead of offering their help to the PCA's. The few med techs that do assist the PCA's when needed make the job of the PCA's a little less hectic. 
Having managers that appreciate what you as a PCA or med tech do on a daily basis make it a great place to work. For example if an aid is proud of something that they did and they want to share their accomplishments with a manager and the manager instead shuts them down and tells them how they should of done it differently makes the aid feel like what they do is not appreciated. The rate of pay to the amount of work that is to be done here is what could make this a great place to work. Alot of new employees get hired and once they start working and see the work load to the pay, alot of people will quit here and go to another job that the pay is matching the work load. This then causes a high turnover in employees. ",Co-Workers/Teamwork,Positive,3,2,0

Often patients have not been gotten out of bed yet, dressed or been offered breakfast yet. Often, I have to delete and redo TEN  notes up to 3 times because someone else entered inacurrate information so I get an error message and I am unable to esign a note. Frequently a patient has a behavior with another team member that I am more than happy to stop what I am doing and assist my team member if I truly believe there is a way for me to help. I have also run into situations where a team member is working with a patient who we can not for whatever reason co-treat with but must have a second person for a safe and effective treatment. I do not feel the company executives are not at all sympathetic to these situations. While regular weekly meetings are very important to review information on the  patients on caseload with all involved disciplines these meetings can take a good chunk out of our productivity before we even hit the floor to treat patients.  In addition we have family members who frequently want to talk privately about their loved one outside of the specific treatment time.

Our CEO takes time to connect with employees at every level on a daily basis. He is very approachable, as is the rest of our Leadership Team.

Our Leadership Team and our Extended Leadership Team engage in professional development exercises every other month.

It stinks that I have all this sick time earned, but can't take it for personal time off just because I'm not technically ""sick.""  And in spite of that, sick time doesn't even get paid out.  Makes no sense.  Plus, someone at my level with my background should earn twice the vacation time that I have, in my opinion.  When I asked about that when I was hired, I was told that nothing could be done to accommodate, it is what it is.  It seems like something very simple (and low-cost to the company) to increase employee morale.

Also, permitting casual dress every day would be awesome (another easy, low-cost change).

Additionally, I think requiring employee performance reviews (quarterly, if not at least annually) would be helpful.  Good for accountability and goal setting.  

Finally, if there's any way the air temperature in the corporate office could be increased to a more tolerable temperature, that would be appreciated as well.  It is always so very cold (at least in my office).

Management does not come out on the floor to help when it is needed or requested (excluding the HSD, as she does at times). We recently had an incident where a resident slapped another and nothing was done and the same resident had another conflict three days later, ending with the victim resident having a fractured vertebra. The team is told constantly that we are low-census, so we feel in that incident, nothing was done to prevent the loss of another resident. We also have residents in there who do not meet assisted-living standards and are also not on hospice, but the management team will not do anything about it in fear that we will lose more residents. If we are going to accept residents in this state, we need to exclude â€œassisted-livingâ€ from our title of business. The manager responsible for bringing other residents in walks around the facility acting like she knows staff and the residents, but as soon as the tour is over and the group has left, she goes right back to her office and never makes an attempt to get to truly know the staff or residents. She also makes empty promises to families that staff cannot meet (or legally cannot do) to draw new residents in. Recently she did this and the new resident moved out one week later due to the fact. That would not reflect greatly on our reviews, Iâ€™m sure. How does it work to try and bring people into the facility when you donâ€™t know the staff to sell their great points? Obviously it doesnâ€™t or we would have more residents. The same manager has been heard to have said â€œthe staff should all be fired and have agency come in for a fresh start.â€ What a team dividing (and not building) statement to hear as a staff member when you work as hard as you do for each resident, which is the only reason I am staying at this job at this point in time. There are a lot of problems that stem from management that cause a lot of hardship between staff members. Things seem to be divided (managers vs. floor staff) and that is definitely not what should be happening. If you want a better facility with the best staff, give us a better management team.

Management often hides things from families and will lie if they feel decisions they've made will make them look bad. Recently, we had a resident to resident (one residents 6th time in 7 months including a brain bleed and fractured spine to otger residents) and management told Hospice and the other resident's family he had been sent out for a phych eval. This was untrue, he remained in the facility and did not even have a 1 on 1. When family arrived we were put in an awkard position. We are not allowed to divulge any info due to HIPPA but they knew they were cleary lied to. Our activities director refuses to to do activities with any cognitively declines residents. She puts headphones on them and leaves-often for nursing staff to find nothing is even playing. There have been episodes of residents eating epsom salts that were not ckeaned, paints left out, and beads being eaten. The only residents that receive any activity are the ones who are able to fully participate at a high functioning level. Last week, she took her ""regulars"" to lunch but when asked if a different resident could go for once, she was disgtuntled but approved. Until the resident asked to use the restroom before leaving and she was left in the bathroom. The resident was very upset, saying, ""I wasn't fast enough, my ride left me."" Resident continued throughout afternoon to be upset. When reported to management, they stated someone could her a sandwich back. The same activity director also removed a resident from our grand dining room during snack because she didnt like the conversation they were having about the previous residents attack on her. Instead of changing the topic or using a distraction, she escorted her to another room and left her by herself. The newest staff member hired is our marketing director, after 5 months she has yet to bring an appropriate resident. They've accepted skilled pt.'s, not on hospice with foley catheters that have to be discharged within a week. They then cut nursing staff hours or fire the people that are not their favorite until we are short staffed. They then threaten to let us go and get agency if we don't pick up extra shifts. Managers often sit behind closed doors of their office and do not interact with residents or nurses because we are clearly beneath them.  Autumn Hills is not very old and due to lack of care is starting to look pitiful. Past residents families will tell other community members that the nursing, kitchen, and laundry staff is amazing but not worth dealing with management. We have a 1 star rating on Google. The other memory care facility within 5 miles has 5 stars and a waiting list of 10 people while they are at capacity. We are never going to grow or be respected with the current management team we have. It is very hard to entice better employees or sometimes convince yourself to even stay with such poor leaders. Although I feel like this survey is a formality and will not do any good, I hope someone cares enough to at least speak with the employees and resident family members to confirm these accusations. We have so much  potential and the ability to be one of the best facilities in our area if we had good leaders. I don't understand why corporate doesn't want us to succeed or pay attention to our low census, unhappy family members, and staff that has reigned to the fact nothing can be done.

I have been a caregiver to the elderly since 1990 and I take great pride in treating them with the dignity and respect that they so deserve at the end stages of their life. I believe that this could be a great place to work but it would have to start from the top. I have seen so many great caregivers walk out the door due to unfairness, favoritism and poor management. The executive director of The Randall Residence of Tipp City micromanages, fraternizes with employees and family members in the most unprofessional ways I have ever witnessed. She is literally running that facility in the ground while her subordinates try to keep it going. I have a photo saved on my phone of the night shift crew stacking furniture at the end of one of the hallways to keep residents in a designated area as to not wander for their convenience. This was a fire hazard, unlawful and not to mention downright abuse. When reported it was ignored and dismissed as alot of things are. I understand that this is a business for profit but when I read your mission statement I was sure that this was gonna be a great, rewarding place to work. I know that you may dismiss this as a disgruntled employee but I tell you this...when I walk into The Randall Residence of Tipp City I give those elderly people in the memory care unit 100 percent. I always have on my mind that these are someones parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles and best friends. They have fought in wars and paved the way for us to be who we are today and they deserve to get the care that they pay for whether they are of sound mind or not. I know that is how I would want my family members treated. And that is the mindset I have when I come to work at your facility. Being a caregiver is mentally and physically exhausting but also rewarding at the same time. This facility has no consequences for peoples actions unless it is convenient for the executive director. I worked there for 3 years full time and pursued another career path due to the conditions there but continue to stay prn because I love the elderly population. I hope this prompts you to investigate the day to day operations at this facility and hopefully the outcome of this investigation will be better quality care for the residents of The Randall Residence of Tipp City.

We have been repeatedly told that the company is not doing well financially thus we will be receiving no raises however the company has been very quick to take on new contracts with new companies and hiring many new staff instead of taking care of those they have. I do not feel that my work is valued or that I am appreciated by management due to not receiving any incentives since starting with infinity rehab. I only feel valued by my immediate co-workers and rehab director. We often feel that our department is very forgotten when it comes to upper level management and I have been a therapist for a very long time and feel I work with one of the best rehab teams within infinity rehab. My team is great solely because of the co-workers I have not because of anything management has done.

If a bad hire is not responding to additional coaching and feedback, they need to be let go during their probationary period instead of being shuffled around campus. Overtime should revert to 8 and 80, as it provides incentive to managers to move with alacrity when positions are available, instead of relying on a few PCAs to work all 3 shifts through out the pay period. It is also much more difficult to cover last minute call offs when only regular pay is offered. Many of our families are understanding If we make overtime pay, but are less so for regular pay if we pick up a shift at the last minute to cover those call offs. 

When care levels become significantly heavier and residents become enhanced due to increased care needs, extra hours need to be made available before coworkers become tired of being set up for failure and leave.

Employees at every level go above and beyond to ensure residents are well cared for and their individual needs are met.  If we do not have something a resident would like and we are made aware, we make it happen for them if within regulatory guidelines.

Employees have high integrity and do the right things regardless of who is watching.  Makes it easy to trust your team and helps to create a work environment conducive to attaining the companies mission.

Staff is encouraged to participate with the resident during activities and actually enjoy doing so, make for a fun and welcoming environment.  If there are activities during the day where staff will get a free meal or something extra is offered, night staff is not overlooked and are provided something comparable to what day staff received.

There are so many activities available to the residents and if a suggestion is made, therapeutic recreation will go above and beyond to make it happen.  

If a resident has concerns about their spouse/loved ones during their time apart, social services will work with the resident, their family and all departments necessary to ensure these concerns are taken care of.

Employees are kind to each other, show mutual respect for each others individuality and preferences.  Open communication is welcomed and encouraged.

There is a lot of understanding and flexibility with scheduling if given enough notice or if illness or the unexpected occur last minute.

Suggestions for improvement are welcomed, evaluated and implemented if indicated.  If implementation is not recommended, follow up occurs without fail as to why.",Inspiring Work/Place; Quality,Positive,7,2,2

As an employee, I feel like some of the managers and leadership staff are ""superior"" than  the rest of the employees and do not take into account the employees wishes, desires, or suggestions. I came into this job for the feeling of ""healthcare redefined"", a place where patient care came first. However, in the last year, I feel as though, it's not so much about the patient anymore, it's all about the money, the numbers, the bottom line--whether that be in the form of hiring freezes, denying yearly reviews for raises, micromanaging, short staffing the CNA's or nit-picking all employees that are ""under"" management; just as so our building looks good on paper with the numbers.  Now, of course there are some management staff that are amazing, but are overworked and underappreciated which leads to turn over, as we have lost some great employees in the past by the way the leader runs the ship here. This is very unfortunate. This should be a place where everyone can work together to ensure, bottom line, that our patients (and family) are well cared for so they will spread the good word about us into the community.

Even if executives did weekend evals it took on an 8 hour day once a quarter. If they did, then they would be able to experience the pressure of documentation requirements, productivity requirements, and managing a challenging caseload, which would hopefully help them learn empathy and think twice before starting a new initiative or criticizing. I know for a fact my ARD has not treated a patient in the last 3 years if not more and yet this ARD will critique buildings for low metrics (e.g. productivity, revenue) and demand an explanation without acknowledging that we are consistently trying. Individual clinicians are feeling as if they have to work off the clock to meet these productivity expectations, which is ILLEGAL but better than not having a job or being written up for arbitrary metrics. 
In addition, due to the pressures of productivity it is hard for clinicians to be a team player (e.g. lend a hand to others in the facility or other clinicians, without feeling as if they are losing billable time). It also prevents therapists from growing professionally as we do not feel we have the time and/or space to be creative in our treatments or try new techniques because we have so many â€œCOREâ€ tests to adhere to.
