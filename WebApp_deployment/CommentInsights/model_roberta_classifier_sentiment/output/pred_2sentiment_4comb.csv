To think that these girls care for our elderly and make less than what they could at the Sheetz up the road from here.  These girls do back breaking, messy jobs and some residents are very hard to care for.  I wish they would be paid more - again - not being one of them -I just watch what they do - admire the work they do - but I see at the end of the shift - in PW - they are physically exhausted and some mentally too.  We have high levels of care and high levels of dementia - combined it's tough on them.   Management kicks in and buys pizza, and gestures of appreciation - but bottom line - they aren't making near enough in my opinion.   Especially to think that there are many levels of management that maybe could be lessened and pay our front line staff better wages.

It was a family feel, and the care was most important. Unfortunately, not anymore. There is a lot wrong.. All that changed. Their expectations are currently too high for what they provide the floor staff, managment doesn't listen to us even when they say ""they will look into it"", and you can try talking to your immediate boss and get ignored for days. The DON is a joke, and acts as if she's the administrator- all staff talks bad about her, she isn't fit for the company. We almost always run out of gloves and wipes and get told its the CNAs fault and dont provide extra until next shipment. There was a time i was in and out of consciousness (some health issues) and my mom called in for me, when I didn't know she did. I was in trouble for that and placed on a 90 day probation, and also refused to give me my yearly raise. I'm used to working 100 hours a paycheck. I also heard they told someone they had to come work when this CNA was having severe back problems, when the nurse asked management about this choice they blew it off. This it the thing.. They are money hungry. The care from the DON is almost non existent. I, and the other employees who have worked here over a year, and high hopes and expectations of this place.

If a person cannot handle extra tasks on top of their daily schedule there should not be a constant ""push"" to take on extra things including Learning Academy, DOR, being a mentor, Clinical Champion at multiple levels, or Clinical Instructor.  These should be things that the employee does on their own accord and time.  I applaud ""Encouraging the Heart"", however, if the employee has expressed that they cannot do something, understand that it's not the right time. 
Also, I understand the concept of making the work place ""fun"", but participating in the ""Happy Video"" was very embarrassing.  I felt bullied by my supervisor at the time to ""have an idea and theme by Friday"" made as a statement indicating that lack of participation would have consequences.  A team idea was born, however, there was no practice for what we did prior to the video and on the video we were uncoordinated and unprofessional.  I felt embarrassed about the video being posted company-wide and did not feel like I had a voice to opt out of it.  I certainly did not feel ""happy"".  There was a similar vein with requests of pictures of people in ""1999"".  I think for something to be ""fun"" within the company, people should want to actively and genuinely participate.  It should be announced, but there should not be pressure for people to participate that may not feel comfortable doing so.

I work full time for another company and have the opportunity at times to work with folks that have been at this facility for one reason or another. They are resoundingly upset, angry and feel uncared for by the nursing staff. There are also many comments that deal with the cleanliness of their rooms, from trash being emptied to used towels not being picked up. I will say personally in my experience, the professional communication between therapy and nursing is poor. I do not feel the information I give to nursing staff is well received, and then it is hardly followed up on. For instance medications that are late, pain meds needed for clients to be able to participate in therapy or questions family may have of nursing nature that I myself can not address. I have personally heard nurses complaining about their caseloads in the halls in front of patients. I fully realize that Iâ€™m not present in this facility often, and tend to let things go because anyone can have a rough day and possibly Iâ€™ve just been there to observe that nurses rough day. However, when coupled with reports from past clients..I do not believe this is the case. Clients have refused to ever go back and have told their friends and family the same, strictly based on the nursing care. Therapy and food services are always reported as good. My feeling is the nature of the nursing department needs to be improved. And quickly if the Suites wants to stand out as a facility among  the numerous other SNF in the immediate area.

The consistently poor management has created a workplace where no one is expected to show up for their shifts, employee performance (or lack thereof) is not monitored at all, and interdepartmental cooperation is impossible due to total lack of communication. The management does not listen to the employees, so serious problems go ignored until they collapse altogether. The management never follows through on rewards programs, and, as far as I have experienced, creates arbitrary barriers to keep employees from receiving bonuses and their due compensation like PTO pay. The mismanagement of this facility is absolutely irresponsible and the burden of keeping the facility in due operation falls upon the small minority of employees that actually feel personally responsible for maintaining a safe and enjoyable living facility for our residents, and these outgoing employees are treated with the same ignorance and disdain as the rest. Though, for the most part, our community of residents maintains a positive disposition, this is absolutely not a good place to work.

Money is apparently so tight that we're asked to take mandatory training, deemed critically important for upcoming changes in Medicare, on our own time at home! And we are given pages of handouts, on the fly, that we're supposed to read and then suddenly have comprehension of a new process. Should I worry about Infinity's financial solvency? Perhaps this company could invest some time into understanding the best ways to manage change. Yes, it's a challenge because not all of the therapists are present any one day - we provide therapies 7 days per week. (Therapists already work weekends at same pay rate as weekdays, and have to use PTO for the same events weekday workers do on their ""days off.""
