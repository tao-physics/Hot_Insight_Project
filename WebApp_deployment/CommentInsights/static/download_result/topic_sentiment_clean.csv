"We are an ALF not a nursing home. Total care without lifts should not be allowed in our facility.

"The pay rate and sometimes how people are treated defiantly need improvement. When I started I was trained in both AL and Pathways and am currently working on getting my dementia training to I can work back in connections. I'm scheduled around 67 hours a pay period but pick up another 60 during that same pay period on both pathways and AL. I work the most out of pathways and recently they hired a CNA, whom which is making more then me and not working as many hours nor picking up as many as \I have. Granted I understand she has a CNA, but at the end of the day we're both doing the same job and its proven with how often some of us pick up we're doing more then her to get paid less. I feel that's terrible and it makes me not want to come to work some days. So in my opinion either send me to get my CNA and pay me the same amount as her, for again doing the same amount of work as her, or change the pay scale, trying to make it equal because it's defiantly not anywhere equal right now and that is extremely frustrating.

Unfortunately, not anymore. There is a lot wrong.. All that changed. Their expectations are currently too high for what they provide the floor staff, managment doesn't listen to us even when they say ""they will look into it"", and you can try talking to your immediate boss and get ignored for days. The DON is a joke, and acts as if she's the administrator- all staff talks bad about her, she isn't fit for the company. We almost always run out of gloves and wipes and get told its the CNAs fault and dont provide extra until next shipment.

I was in trouble for that and placed on a 90 day probation, and also refused to give me my yearly raise. I'm used to working 100 hours a paycheck. I also heard they told someone they had to come work when this CNA was having severe back problems, when the nurse asked management about this choice they blew it off. This it the thing.. They are money hungry. The care from the DON is almost non existent. I, and the other employees who have worked here over a year, and high hopes and expectations of this place.

"Need more staff in Memory Care 1 and 2 and also in AL. Good people are leaving to due short staff in all departments. There are 2 person assist in Memory Care 2 but only have 2 staff. So if the 2 staff go in assist the resident that needs a 2 person assistance, the floor is left unattended. Calling other departments may not be available due to their short staff. There will be other good people that will leave because promises the upper management makes about getting a 3rd person for 2nd shift. And why there are 3 or 4 staff on 1st shift in Memory Care 2. But when it comes to 2nd shift it is only 2 staff. This has been going on for a long time. How could upper management say things will get better in Memory Care. How is that possible when there are 17 residents with different behaviors. A couple of residents can be very aggressive. Doing hourly checks in Memory Care 2 especially when it is bed time.  The staff are required to go into the residents bathroom while he or she sleeps to press a button. The residents gets extremely upset because the staff are disturbing them. If the residents can't get there proper rest means lack of sleep that means the residents does eat well which turns into a decline in health. Hence, It takes some residents awhile to drift off. I do understand why the staff must do it. So when the residents tells the staff not to come back in, but it's our responsibility to make that check visual and press the button in their bathroom,do we do as the request or do what we are instructed to do from upper management. We work really hard in Memory Care 2. 2nd shift nor 1st shift still haven't received our appreciation.",Staffing and Scheduling,Co-Workers/Teamwork,0.0038976740010756724,Negative,Positive

"More help in the kitchen.  Possibly 2 part-time dishwasher/prep cooks.  A great entry level job for a high school or college student.  This would enable me to concentrate/develop culinary practices that would provide better tasting meals.  So busy cleaning pots and pans in between meals by myself...there is minimal time at best to really focus on better ways to prepare and turn out more flavorful food.  I attended Johnson and Wales Culinary school and have a B.S. in Accounting, and feel we could benefit by cooking from scratch more instead of packaged/precooked foods.  The food would taste much better and would probably be more cost efficient.  However, we do not have the personnel nor the time to devote to the true art of culinary creativity. Having said that I am very grateful for my job and the opportunity to serve this facilities residents and staff.  The Food Services Director does wash pots and pans and cooks too.  She is very overworked.  Lastly.  Here in the south we eat certain foods like Hoppin' John (Rice w/black eyed peas) and Corn Pudding...and our menu is so boring.  The residents eat the same soups, vegetables and meats just about every other day.  Why can't the corporate menu allow for local cuisine to be incorporate into the menu for the locations of their facilities?  People in the midwest do not have the same cuisines as here in the south.  Since many of our residents are from here they would enjoy local dishes more.",Staffing and Scheduling,Co-Workers/Teamwork,0.009163641653800255,Negative,Positive

"We preach ""teamwork"" however many/if not most of the managers do not epitomize this motto. If a resident needs help a manager should be able to help them. When a nurse aide/nurse brings an issue to light they should not be looked at as being negative, but instead looked at as trying to improve the facility especially if they have a solution in hand. They're advocates for the residents and should not be looked down upon when serious issues are brought to light because it's a hindrance. Basic nursing 101 should be addressed by the HSD such as having a community razor. That is infection control and someone in charge should address these issues instead of brushing them off when brought to light.

"Honor and respect that people have personal lives and may not have the ability to take on extra projects.  The job we do is both physically and mentally taxing.  If a person cannot handle extra tasks on top of their daily schedule there should not be a constant ""push"" to take on extra things including Learning Academy, DOR, being a mentor, Clinical Champion at multiple levels, or Clinical Instructor.  These should be things that the employee does on their own accord and time.  I applaud ""Encouraging the Heart"", however, if the employee has expressed that they cannot do something, understand that it's not the right time. 
Also, I understand the concept of making the work place ""fun"", but participating in the ""Happy Video"" was very embarrassing.  I felt bullied by my supervisor at the time to ""have an idea and theme by Friday"" made as a statement indicating that lack of participation would have consequences.  A team idea was born, however, there was no practice for what we did prior to the video and on the video we were uncoordinated and unprofessional.  I felt embarrassed about the video being posted company-wide and did not feel like I had a voice to opt out of it.  I certainly did not feel ""happy"".  There was a similar vein with requests of pictures of people in ""1999"".  I think for something to be ""fun"" within the company, people should want to actively and genuinely participate.  It should be announced, but there should not be pressure for people to participate that may not feel comfortable doing so.

"I work for this company PRN. I work full time for another company and have the opportunity at times to work with folks that have been at this facility for one reason or another. They are resoundingly upset, angry and feel uncared for by the nursing staff. There are also many comments that deal with the cleanliness of their rooms, from trash being emptied to used towels not being picked up. I will say personally in my experience, the professional communication between therapy and nursing is poor. I do not feel the information I give to nursing staff is well received, and then it is hardly followed up on. For instance medications that are late, pain meds needed for clients to be able to participate in therapy or questions family may have of nursing nature that I myself can not address. I have personally heard nurses complaining about their caseloads in the halls in front of patients. I fully realize that Iâ€™m not present in this facility often, and tend to let things go because anyone can have a rough day and possibly Iâ€™ve just been there to observe that nurses rough day. However, when coupled with reports from past clients..I do not believe this is the case. Clients have refused to ever go back and have told their friends and family the same, strictly based on the nursing care. Therapy and food services are always reported as good. My feeling is the nature of the nursing department needs to be improved. And quickly if the Suites wants to stand out as a facility among  the numerous other SNF in the immediate area.

Clocking in and out for lunch is often counterproductive to the flow of my day to day duties and inhibits my attention to resident centered care. Sometimes an unpaid 30 minute lunch is unrealistic during a day of continuously meeting resident needs with precision and timeliness. I am able to eat sufficiently in small amounts and fit it in and around my on-call duties much more efficiently then removing myself from the community for 30 minutes at a time.
Additionally, I find myself anxious about clocking in at the beginning of the day and out at the end of the day with machine like precision and sometimes short myself minutes a week so that I won't cost the company overtime. Despite typically arriving at work 5-10 minutes early and leaving 5-10 minutes after my shift ends.

"If I could change one thing about this company, I would make it so that the management is held accountable for their actions. The consistently poor management has created a workplace where no one is expected to show up for their shifts, employee performance (or lack thereof) is not monitored at all, and interdepartmental cooperation is impossible due to total lack of communication. The management does not listen to the employees, so serious problems go ignored until they collapse altogether. The management never follows through on rewards programs, and, as far as I have experienced, creates arbitrary barriers to keep employees from receiving bonuses and their due compensation like PTO pay. The mismanagement of this facility is absolutely irresponsible and the burden of keeping the facility in due operation falls upon the small minority of employees that actually feel personally responsible for maintaining a safe and enjoyable living facility for our residents, and these outgoing employees are treated with the same ignorance and disdain as the rest. Though, for the most part, our community of residents maintains a positive disposition, this is absolutely not a good place to work.

"There is a serious lack of communication. I personally have sent emails and never received a response from management. There are several people that feel like the first shift is the favorite. They do not seem to get into trouble when they do not complete their job. The residents have brought this up to management, but feel that nothing is being done. The residents also feel that management does not take their input or requests seriously, and several are looking to move out. The staff also feels ignored, and there has been a flood of good workers that have left in the past few months. The people that have been hired are not competent, diligent workers dedicated to caring for the residents to the BEST of their abilities. 
There is also an issue with food ordering. There are several times when the food director does not order sufficient food. The cook does not have the food to prepare, the residents are unhappy with what they are served, and the staff is burdened with complaints from the residents with no way to provide a better experience for them. 
There must be a major change in how BH is run if they would like to retain the staff and residents. ",Communication/Support,Management Reliability/Integrity,0.009584345308497584,Negative,Positive

Dining room executive treats us like we are in the military. Constant threats of being fired. EXTREME micromanagement. We are not allowed to eat any left overs, tons of food is thrown in the trash every night. For a while, I was part time and being scheduled 43 hours a week, and I accidentally showed up for a 12-Cl shift instead of a 10:30-7 and was threatened to be fired and told that I shouldn't have even shown up. Spent two nights in bad weather so I could make it in for shift (there were about 13 call-outs that day) with hardly even a thanks...will never be spending the night again for that purpose.

"Only one thing? I would summarize thusly: Do a better job of managing change! This survey comes at a time that has been stressful in our workplace. My morale is at a low point. Change has come down from above but therapists haven't been given much chance to digest it. Ultimately, upper management at the company seems out of touch.

Money is apparently so tight that we're asked to take mandatory training, deemed critically important for upcoming changes in Medicare, on our own time at home! And we are given pages of handouts, on the fly, that we're supposed to read and then suddenly have comprehension of a new process. Should I worry about Infinity's financial solvency? Perhaps this company could invest some time into understanding the best ways to manage change. Yes, it's a challenge because not all of the therapists are present any one day - we provide therapies 7 days per week. (Therapists already work weekends at same pay rate as weekdays, and have to use PTO for the same events weekday workers do on their ""days off."" Weekend workers generate valuable revenue at a certain personal cost.)

"Management needs improved. People to be held accountable for their actions  Management needs to help the team. Managers( all of them) leave and go to lunch for 2 hours and leave 1 nurse and 3 caregivers to answer phones, open the door, feed in the dining room, chart, toliet, deal with families. To much pressure put on nurses and no other department. Management gossips and plays favorites with schedules, or who gets in trouble for call offs and lates. Not fair across the board. Management is very unprofessional and will gossip. The good employees are the ones used and abused and unappreciated but, if u sit in the admin office and talk to him and whine you get away with everything. Constantly short staffed. Management needs a complete overhaul! Management is not a strong team to lead a building. There is zero Communication between management and the rest of the team. Managment cares only of them selves and not the rest of the team. They have their own clique. Managers do not interact with resident except activities. BOM will close door because she cant work when residents are talking to her. But it's ok for the nurse to be interrupted multiple times while getting meds ready. Managment acts as though they are the gold and the rest of the team is dirt. Managers never solve problems only add them on to other team members. None of the managers are in the building before 10am. And are never on the floor even when we had 3 out of 4 caregivers call off. There's so many issues here and many employees are unhappy and it always points back to management. No problems are ever taken seriously. Problems are never resolved. They just keep adding up.

"The respect level is not well at Quail Ridge. Sandra the head person does not always greet her Staff, in meetings she tends to raise her voice as if we are her children. This causes the mangers under her to feel free to do the same. One supervisor made me move from my chair so she can sit down. I reported her to the nurse. I followed the chain od command. Sandra never addressed me on this matter. The D.O.N. stood at the desk an talked very disrespectful to us. That was the day I decided to put in my 2week notice. If I could change anything at Quail Ridge it would be management. Within a three month period the time the turn over rate has been terrible. I did resigned from being caregiver. Now I work in Dietary PRN and the manager LaTonya is a excellent supervisor. I really appreciate she seen a great Staff in me.

I have worked here 11 years and the one thing I would change would be the caregiver role in the dining room.  It is up to the caregivers to serve breakfast in the morning serve lunch and dinner and clean and reset the tables plus try to do all the other roles of caregiving.  This is too much on them.  I was a caregiver before going to community life it is and still is a task that just doesn't make sense that is a task that should be done by our dining staff.
